# HTML & CSS Carousel

This example is a lightweight implementation of a Slide Carroussel, using HTML and CSS only, Why is this important? Carousels are one of the most popular ways of showing self-contained information, there are several implementations such as [jCarousel](http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/) or [Bootstrap's Carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/examples/carousel/), but sometimes loading a complete library for adding a simple feature like this may be an overkill.

``` html
<div id="carousel">
        <ul>
            <li data-index=1>1</li>
            <li data-index=2>2</li>
            <li data-index=3>3</li>
            <li data-index=4>4</li>
            <li data-index=5>5</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
```
